## Intro

This project is less about any specific code or implementation details, but more about well defined and organized Xcode project architecture (ie. configuration, modularization, tooling, scripts etc.). It's a multi-platform project (iOS / macOS) made with SwiftUI, containing multiple targets (App / Widgets / Tests), supporting different environments (Dev / Live) and integrating ready to use tools (SwiftLint / SwiftFormat / SwiftGen). Code is modularized using Swift packages, with "TopLevel" package orchestrating other packages and producing libraries used by the product targets. Run the above command to bootstrap a new project from this one, thus getting everything previously mentioned, out of the box. Enjoy making your "greenfield" projects! ðŸŒ±

## Hints

> In order to build on device, set Apple Developer Team ID ([edits this file](Config/Common.xcconfig)):

```
